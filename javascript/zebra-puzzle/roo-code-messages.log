However, the `.docs` directory is not listed in the current working directory file list, which suggests it might be hidden or simply not listed yet. Since the user instructed not to use the ask_followup_question tool, I will proceed by listing all files recursively to locate `.docs` and the relevant markdown instructions.\n\nOnce I find the `.docs` directory and the markdown file(s), I will read them to understand the exercise requirements. After that, I will inspect the stub implementation file (`zebra-puzzle.js`) and the test file (`zebra-puzzle.spec.js`). Then, I will implement the solution, verify it against the tests, and run the necessary commands (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm test`).\n\nFirst step: list all files recursively to locate `.docs` and any markdown files inside it.",
