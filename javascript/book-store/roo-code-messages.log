Count the occurrences of each distinct book in the input basket.\n2.  Iteratively form sets of distinct books, always taking the largest possible set size (number of distinct books currently available). Store the size of each set formed.\n3.  After forming all initial sets, apply the optimization: while there's a set of 5 and a set of 3 in our list of set sizes, replace them with two sets of 4.\n4.
