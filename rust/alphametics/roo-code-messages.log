However, the `.docs` directory is not currently listed in the environment details, which only show the root directory contents. To proceed, I need to locate and read the exercise description markdown files inside `.docs`. Since `.docs` is not visible, it might be hidden or simply not listed yet.\n\nMy first step is to list all files and directories recursively from the project root to reveal `.docs` and its contents. This will help me identify the markdown file(s) containing the exercise description.\n\nOnce I have the markdown file(s), I will read them to understand the problem requirements. Then, I will inspect the implementation stub (likely in `src/lib.rs`) and the test file (`tests/alphametics.rs`). After that, I will implement the solution in the stub file and finally run `cargo test` to verify correctness.\n\nFirst, I will list all files recursively to locate `.docs` and its contents.",
