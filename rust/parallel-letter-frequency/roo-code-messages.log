I need to replace this with an implementation that:\n\n- Processes the input slice of string slices.\n- Counts alphabetic characters (including accented ones), ignoring case.\n- Ignores punctuation, digits, and other non-alphabetic characters.\n- Uses parallel processing with the specified number of workers.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\n1. **Flatten input**: Combine all input lines into a single iterator of characters.\n2. **Filter characters**: Keep only alphabetic characters (`char::is_alphabetic`), convert to lowercase.\n3. **Parallel processing**:\n   - Split the input into `worker_count` roughly equal chunks.\n   - Process each chunk in a separate thread, counting character frequencies locally.\n   - Merge the local frequency maps into a final global map.\n4. **Return** the global frequency map.\n\nI will use Rust's `std::thread` for parallelism, as external crates like `rayon` are likely not allowed here.\n\nNow, I will implement this plan by replacing the `todo!` macro in `src/lib.rs`.",
