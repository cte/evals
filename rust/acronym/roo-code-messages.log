The logic needs to handle word boundaries (spaces, hyphens, underscores), ignore punctuation like commas and apostrophes within words, and also capture uppercase letters that follow lowercase letters (like in \"HyperText\").\n\nHere's the implementation based on iterating through the characters and checking the previous character's state:\n\n```rust\npub fn abbreviate(phrase: &str) -> String {\n    let mut acronym = String::new();\n    // Keep track of the previous character to detect camelCase transitions\n    // and word boundaries. Initialize with a non-letter to handle the first char.\n    let mut prev_char = ' ';\n\n    for current_char in phrase.chars() {\n        // Condition 1: First letter of a word (previous was not a letter, current is)\n        // Condition 2: CamelCase (previous was lowercase, current is uppercase)\n        if (!prev_char.is_alphabetic() && current_char.is_alphabetic()) ||\n           (prev_char.is_lowercase() && current_char.is_uppercase()) {\n            acronym.push(current_char.to_ascii_uppercase());\n        }\n        // Update previous character state, but treat apostrophes as letters\n        // to prevent them from incorrectly starting a new acronym letter.\n        // Other non-alphabetic chars act as separators.\n        if current_char != '\\'' {\n             prev_char = current_char;\n        } else {\n             // Ensure apostrophe doesn't break a word boundary check\n             // Treat it like a letter for the *next* character's check\n             if prev_char.is_alphabetic() {\n                 // If prev was already alpha, keep it that way\n             } else {\n                 // If prev was not alpha (e.g., space before \" 'word' \"),\n                 // don't let the apostrophe make prev_char alphabetic.\n                 // Keep prev_char as it was (non-alphabetic).\n             }\n             // In simpler terms: only update prev_char if current_char is NOT an apostrophe.\n             // This implicitly handles the apostrophe logic correctly by maintaining the state\n             // of the character *before* the apostrophe. Let's revert to the simpler logic.\n             // prev_char = current_char; // This was the original simpler logic line\n        }\n         // Reverting to the simpler logic: only update prev_char if it's not an apostrophe.\n         // This correctly handles cases like \"Halley's\" (prev stays 'y' when current is ''')\n         // and \" 'word' \" (prev stays ' ' when current is ''').\n         if current_char != '\\'' {\n            prev_char = current_char;\n         }\n    }\n\n    acronym\n}\n```\nLet me simplify the logic slightly for clarity and apply it.",
