  "text": "It seems I went back and forth with the newline characters. Let's analyze the requirements again based on the test failures:\n\n1.  **Single Verse Tests (`testVerseOne`, `testVerseTwo`, etc.):** These expect the string returned by `verse(n)` to end with a single newline (`\\n`). The output shows the expected string has a newline at the end, but the actual string does not.\n2.  **Multiple Verse Tests (`testFirstThreeVerses`, `testSingWholeSong`, etc.):** These expect the verses to be separated by *two* newline characters (`\\n\\n`).\n\nMy last change removed the newline from `verse()`, which broke the single verse tests again. The `verses()` method joins with `\\n\\n`, which is also incorrect based on the desired logic.\n\nThe correct logic is:\n*   `verse(n)` should return the verse string *including* a trailing newline (`\\n`).\n*   `verses(start, end)` should call `verse(n)` for each verse and join them using a *single* newline (`\\n`) as the delimiter. Since each verse already ends in `\\n`, joining with `\\n` will result in the desired `\\n\\n` separation.\n\nLet's apply these corrections:\n1.  Add `+ \"\\n\"` back to the `verse` method's return statement.\n2.  Change the `Collectors.joining(\"\\n\\n\")` in the `verses` method back to `Collectors.joining(\"\\n\")`.",
