To proceed, I will list all files and directories recursively from the current working directory to locate `.docs` and access the exercise description.\n\nOnce I find the `.docs` directory, I will read the markdown files inside to understand the exercise requirements. Then, I will examine the implementation stub (likely `src/main/java/TwelveDays.java`) and the test file (`src/test/java/TwelveDaysTest.java`). After that, I will implement the solution, run the tests using `./gradlew test`, and ensure all tests pass.\n\nThe immediate next step is to search for the `.docs` directory.",
