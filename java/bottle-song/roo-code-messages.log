  "text": "The test failures indicate two main issues:\n\n1. The word for the next bottle count in the line `\"There'll be X green bottles hanging on the wall.\"` is incorrectly capitalized (e.g., \"There'll be Nine green bottles...\" instead of \"There'll be nine green bottles...\").\n2. When the next bottle count is 1, the line incorrectly says `\"There'll be one green bottles...\"` (plural) instead of `\"There'll be one green bottle...\"` (singular). Similarly, when the current count is 1, it should be \"One green bottle...\" not \"One green bottles...\".\n\nTo fix this:\n- The capitalization for the next bottle count should always be lowercase, except when it is \"No\" at the start of a verse.\n- The pluralization of \"bottle\" should be singular (\"bottle\") when the count is 1, and plural (\"bottles\") otherwise.\n\nI will update the implementation to handle these two issues accordingly.",
