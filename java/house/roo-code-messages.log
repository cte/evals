Define two static final arrays: one for the subjects (e.g., \"the malt\", \"the rat\") and one for the actions linking them (e.g., \"lay in\", \"ate\").\n2.  Implement `verse(int verse)`: Construct the specified verse using the arrays. It will start with \"This is [subject]\" and recursively add \"that [action] [previous subject]\" until it reaches \"the house that Jack built.\".\n3.  Implement `verses(int startVerse, int endVerse)`: Loop from `startVerse` to `endVerse`, call `verse(i)` for each, and join the results with a newline character (`\\n`).\n4.  Implement `sing()`: Call `verses(1, 12)` to get the entire rhyme.\n\nHere is the code for `src/main/java/House.java`:",
