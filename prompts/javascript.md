Your job is to complete a coding exercise described the markdown files inside the `docs` directory.

A file with the implementation stubbed out has been created for you, along with a test file.

To successfully complete the exercise, you must pass all the tests in the test file.

To confirm that your solution is correct, run the tests with `pnpm test`. Do not alter the test file; it should be run as-is.

Before running the tests make sure your environment is set up by running `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to install the dependencies.

Do not use the "ask_followup_question" tool. Your job isn't done until the tests pass. Don't attempt completion until you run the tests and they pass.
