Your job is to complete a coding exercise described the markdown files inside the `docs` directory.

A file with the implementation stubbed out has been created for you, along with a test file (the tests should be failing initially).

To successfully complete the exercise, you must pass all the tests in the test file.

To confirm that your solution is correct, you can compile your code and run the tests with:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DEXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS=1 ..
make
```

Note that running `make` will compile the tests and generate compile time errors. Once the errors are fixed, running `make` will build and run the tests.

Do not alter the test file; it should be run as-is.

Do not use the "ask_followup_question" tool. Your job isn't done until the tests pass. Don't attempt completion until you run the tests and they pass.

You should start by reading the files in the `docs` directory so that you understand the exercise, and then examine the stubbed out implementation and the test file.
