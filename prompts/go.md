Your job is to complete a coding exercise described the markdown files inside the `.docs` directory.

A file with the implementation stubbed out has been created for you, along with a test file.

To successfully complete the exercise, you must pass all the tests in the test file.

To confirm that your solution is correct, run the tests with `go test`. Do not alter the test file; it should be run as-is.

Do not use the "ask_followup_question" tool.
