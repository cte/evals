  "text": "Most tests pass, but failures occur on questions involving negative numbers with multiplication and division:\n- `\"What is -3 multiplied by 25?\"`\n- `\"What is 33 divided by -3?\"`\n- `\"What is 2 multiplied by -2 multiplied by 3?\"`\n- `\"What is -3 plus 7 multiplied by -2?\"`\n- `\"What is -12 divided by 2 divided by -3?\"`\n\nThe common factor is negative numbers following operations. The parser likely fails to recognize negative numbers after the first token.\n\nIn the current implementation, the tokenizer treats tokens separated by spaces, but multi-word operators are handled separately. However, negative numbers after operators are split into two tokens: `\"-3\"` is seen as `\"-3\"` (correct), but the tokenizer may not handle the minus sign correctly when it appears after an operator.\n\nI will adjust the tokenizer to correctly parse negative numbers appearing after operators.",
