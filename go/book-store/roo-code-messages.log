  "text": "Okay, the instructions describe a discount system for buying multiple different books from a 5-book series. The goal is to calculate the minimum possible price for a given basket of books by grouping them into sets with different titles to maximize the discount. The key challenge is that simply forming the largest possible sets greedily might not yield the best price, as demonstrated by the example where two sets of 4 books are cheaper than one set of 5 and one set of 3.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is:\n1. Count the occurrences of each distinct book.\n2. Iteratively form the largest possible sets of *distinct* books from the remaining counts until no books are left. Keep track of the sizes of these sets.\n3. Apply an optimization: If the list of set sizes contains both a 5 and a 3, replace one pair of (5, 3) with two 4s, as this combination yields a better discount (`2 * Cost(4) < Cost(5) + Cost(3)`). Repeat this replacement until no more (5, 3) pairs exist.\n4. Calculate the final cost by summing the discounted prices for each set size in the potentially modified list.\n\nDiscounts:\n- 1 book: 0% (Cost: 1 * 8 * 1.00 = 800 cents)\n- 2 books: 5% (Cost: 2 * 8 * 0.95 = 1520 cents)\n- 3 books: 10% (Cost: 3 * 8 * 0.90 = 2160 cents)\n- 4 books: 20% (Cost: 4 * 8 * 0.80 = 2560 cents)\n- 5 books: 25% (Cost: 5 * 8 * 0.75 = 3000 cents)\n(Using cents to avoid floating-point issues).\n\nBefore implementing, I'll quickly check the other instruction file, `instructions.append.md`.",
